# MKWY

Ah, the oldest still-active project under my belt. _Mikemingway,_ a portmanteau of _Mike_ and _Hemingway_ was my first sortie in web design, branding myself, marketing, organized photographic collections, and in figuring out who I am.

As noted, I _learned_ web design on this site. While this project is categorized as such because it was initially my exercise in web design, this could also safely fall into visual style crafing, SEO, and of course, photography.

The logo on the top left of this site has actually remained largely the same since the very very inception of the brand. While I never watermarked my images; all my handmade buisness cards, web presence and the like had this little superimposed 'M & H' design.

Looking back, it was rather cute. I write the whole thing in [Brackets](brackets.io), and all my CSS was plain ol' cascading style sheets - and all in one long file, too. I had at least lerned of minification.

I owe so much of my drive to build to a podcast I was listening to at the time, "Seanwes." Nigh-daily (and eventually weekly as I cought up with the backlog), hour-long shows about productivity and defining one's buisness.

By 2016 I had decided on transitioning into a CMS [as detailed](https://photo.michaelhemingway.com/new-site-new-rythm/) in this old post of mine. With that project I taught myself better WordPress, after dipping my toes with the [the plant.](./the-plant)
