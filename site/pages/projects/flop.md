Flop was a game design collective based in Montreal where all sorts of fun people came together to make, discuss and present games.

My involvement with the group spans games submitted, branding and documentation of some rather impressive events hosted by flop. The group ran from 2017 to 2019. During this time, meetings were organized where freely-admitted participants presented their games (physical or digital), usually with a playtester from the audience.
