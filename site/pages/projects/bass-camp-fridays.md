# Bass Camp Fridays

This project consisted primarily of banner designs for social media to promote the Bass Camp Fridays series of events, with sub-designs for each performer and gig.

The challenge largely lay in creating an attractive design in one solution that would work across desktop and mobile social media crops. At different sizes, more or less of the final design would be [visible to the user.](/assets/img/work/BCF/fb.png)

This was done entirely in illustrator, from concept, iteration, to final deliverable.
