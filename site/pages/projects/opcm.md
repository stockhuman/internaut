# The OPCM

The _Orchestre Philharmonique et Choeur des Mélomanes_, or the OPCM for short, is a Montreal-based youth orchestra and choir.

A young non-profit started in 2014 fot Arthem's then-ideal candidate. I, and thus Arthem, wanted exactly that kind of up-and-coming company in the creative industry. The OPCM, being that and also a non-profit, was superb.

The site was realized concurrently with [5ft25](/5ft25), another WordPress project. The challenges in this one however rested in both a need for bilingual site design meshed with deep content, and the lack of an established design language for such orchestras on the web.

Working with legacy color schemes, logo design and imagery proved to be a challenge too, especially considering the proposition of marrying the young appeal of the orchestra with a subject so thoroughly entrenched in the classical tradition.
