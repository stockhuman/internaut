# Milieux

A custom theme for the [Milieux Institute](milieux.concordia.ca) at Concordia University, Montreal.

The design features heavy integration with the as-of-then yet unreleased Gutenberg editor, and custom components including an always-active Twitter timeline.

On the backend, pain points and server misconfigurations were identified to dramatically improve time to first meaningful paint.

Additionally, [Milieux-blocks](https://github.com/stockHuman/milieux-blocks) can be found here, showcasing the heavy React & REST API integration of the Gutenberg project and this theme.
