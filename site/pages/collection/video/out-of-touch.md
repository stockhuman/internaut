On a whim, I made this video with the format of the _[Out of Touch meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/out-of-touch-thursday)_. My take as seen here is an odd compilation of archival news footage spanning the first two decades of the 2000s. There was no brief and no particular audience for this piece, so it turned into something entirely suited to my tastes alone. It was for that reason, that little bit of retrospective, political video art got even the slightest attention without publishing it anywhere but YouTube, that I was delighted.

To my great dismay, a few short days after discovering there were comments on my video (that had now garnered a thousand and some views), Youtube inexplicably [deleted my video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqFknLqe3k) citing promotion of terrorism. I could not reply to the sweet comments people left, and the appeal to YouTube failed.

Following that, I removed my content from the platform, deeming it unsafe for storage in any meaningful way.
