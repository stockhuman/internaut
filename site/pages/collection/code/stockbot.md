StockBot (v1, as contrasted with v0) is a Node.js trading bot with backtesting utilities built in. It owes a debt to [Gekko](https://github.com/xFFFFF/Gekko-Strategies), as well as a number of research papers and authors who contributed to the strategies implemented.

The bot integrated with an unofficial wealthsimple API to manage trades, as well as [IEX cloud](https://iexcloud.io/) for historical data and live market prices. This was, indeed, not a crypto bot but a stock trading application, as the name suggests.
