A gallery shooter from another perspective. This was a proof-of-concept game built to explore the bullet-hell-scroller genre from the perspective of the oncoming 'enemies'. The question posed is, why are so many ships coming your way, and why do they fly in such strange patterns.

Mechanics for the frequent power ups and waves of ships were explored with lore justifications, flipping the script on the player protagonist, AI antagonist: having you play as an increasingly troubled Air Traffic Control operator coordinating an escape from the ever powerful assault of a lone gunship. You send civilian ships in great numbers in the hopes that some make it through, and balance resources to purchase drone ships - saving lives and potentially damaging the enemy, but at great resource cost.
