In the winter, when the leaves left and the wind returned, the bigger apes came. It was the last winter, two seasons ago, when I saw the sticks.

Really, I awoke in them. A new day started and I was already in them, but my brother knows more than I do. He told me that I was really awake, and running, before the sticks. He too, was awake, or so he says, and he remembers a lot more than I do because he wasn't sleeping. The big sticks, as much as I remember them myself without the stories if my brother, were about twice as tall as I was, and all around.
