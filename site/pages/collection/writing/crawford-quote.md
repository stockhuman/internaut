Today, Crawford is sixty-three. "I have already expended most of my beads," he wrote on his blog many years ago, when he turned sixty. "There aren't that many beads left, to finish everything that I want to do in my life."

This quote and my subsequent deep-dive into the man for the second time in my life so far have inspired _[a hidden page](/life)_ on this site.

In time, I plan on starting a true app to do the same, and it will be called, or at least codenamed, "Jars".
