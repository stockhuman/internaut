"My first ever rogue-like game:

Idea: keep a list of all creatures, always put the player on the first spot on that list, allow the player to control the first spot on the list and have AI control the rest. If a creature dies, remove it from the list.

End result: if the player dies, you end up controlling a random creature (often the one who killed you). If that creature dies, you end up controlling another. Rinse and repeat, until there are no more bodies for you to reincarnate in and the game crashes."
