		<p>Greetings 👋</p>
		<p>I'm Michael, and this is my psuedo-blog and portfolio site. Find here project documentation, a means of <a href="contact">contacting me</a> and a few social links here and there.</p>
		<p>I'm living in Montreal, Canada, though I was born and spent my youth in Italy. I try to return as often as I can.</p>
		<p>I have since consolidated my interests around the creatively technical; leveraging skills in programming, 3D design and the visual arts towards a crystallized core of themes I find myself deeply engaged in. Philosophy of the <a href="/projects/jars/">measured self</a>, radically democratized political organisation, semiotics, and FOSS audio hardware (out of all things) motivate the majority of the projects I take on.</p>

		<p>Like a diary, find a previous <i>about me text</i> below.</p>

		<p>Hi, I am more sure of who I am now.</p>

		<p>Hello, I'm not really sure of who I am, but I once wrote this bio:</p>
		<p>"Michael Hemingway is a photographer and multimedia artist living in Montreal. His photojournalistic work concerns itself mostly with the action of the pamplona fiesta, and concert photography at home. He is taking his undergraduate in Computation Arts at Concordia University, fusing photography with video, programming, music and interactive art. Michael started <a href="https://arthem.co">Arthem Co.</a> in college, a small web design business that he still operates today, with a particular focus on the experimental and new."</p>

		<p><a href="/this-site">This site</a>, like my<a href="https://photo.michaelhemingway.com"> photography one</a> before it, exists as a repository for my recent work. What that entails is an uneven mix of games, traditional graphic design, video, code and audio work.</p>
