# It me

Hey there! There's a much more human-readable version of this up at [michaelhemingway.com](https://michaelhemingway.com)!

If you're really here to scrutinize my content and find all my secrets, you'll want to check out [Nanogen](https://github.com/doug2k1/nanogen), which is an old project whose structure Internaut is based upon. Earlier iterations of this site worked with [Harp.js](http://harpjs.com/), but that was abandoned as it is is no longer maintained.

Beyond a few tricks, I don't know how useful one could find this repository, as it's rather tightly-coupled to it's function: building my website.
